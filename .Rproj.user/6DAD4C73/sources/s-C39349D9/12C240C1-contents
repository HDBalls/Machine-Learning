## Executive Summary
I wanted to evaluate whether fuel economy was affected by either automatic or manual transmission and also to find which was better for fuel economy. 
I did some exploratory analysis to have a quick understanding of the data as well as to form an initial and simple hypothesis. 
A hypothesis test was then performed to ensure that differences seen were not as a result of any sampling errors. 
A correlation test was also done to check for non-independence between possible additional variables. 
The interaction between the variables was assessed using a Liklihood Ratio Test. 
Then, Linear Regression was used to fit a model to the data to make predictions about fuel economy with respect to the weight of a vehicle.
Multiple models were also examined to see which combination of predictors best explained and predicted the mpg. 
The last step was to use Regression Diagnostics to check the validity of the model as well as to verify any assumptions that were made. 

##Install the packages echo=FALSE
```{r, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
destination <- getwd()
r = getOption("repos")
r["CRAN"] = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"
options(repos = r)
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("lmtest")
install.packages("flextable")
```

##Load the libraries
```{r, Load Libraries}
library("data.table")
library("ggplot2")
library("lmtest")
library("flextable")
library("dplyr")
library("tinytex")
```



## Load the Data
```{r, Load Data}
data(mtcars)
car_data <- tbl_df(mtcars)
summary(car_data)
```

## Exploratory Analysis
```{r, Exploratory Analysis}
MPG_By_Trans <- car_data %>%
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(avgMPG = mean(mpg))
View(MPG_By_Trans) 
# The initial analysis shows that automatic has a much lower MPG than manual vehicles
# Create a boxplot for further analysis
car_plot_1<-ggplot(car_data, aes(x=factor(am), y=mpg)) + geom_boxplot()
print(car_plot_1)
```
# Do a T Test
```{r, T-Testing}
Transmission_Test <- t.test(mpg ~ am,data=car_data)
```
```{r, echo = TRUE}
exit_values_1 <- tibble(
  "P Value" = c(Transmission_Test$p.value),
  "Confidence Interval" = c(Transmission_Test$conf.int))
flextable(exit_values_1)
```
 
- 1.The p-value from above is quite good at < .0014 so I can confidently reject the Null Hypothesis. 
- 2.There is a high probability of a difference in means.

# Check for Correlation
```{r, Correlation Check}
car_plot_2 <-ggplot(car_data, aes(x=factor(am), y=mpg)) + geom_point()
print(car_plot_2)
```

```{r, Correlation Testing}
cor.test(car_data$mpg,car_data$wt) 
cor.test(car_data$cyl,car_data$mpg)
cor.test(car_data$cyl, car_data$wt)
```
There seems to be a strong correlation between weight and cylinders as well as the MPG.

# Regression Model
```{r, Linear Regression_1}
car_model <- lm(mpg ~ am, data=car_data)
summary(car_model)
car_model$coef
# Using a second model
car_model_2 <- lm(car_data$mpg ~ car_data$am + car_data$wt)
summary(car_model_2)
```
car_model_2 is better than car_model_1

# Including interactions between the weight and the transmission type
```{r,Linear Regression_2}
car_model_3 <- lm(car_data$mpg ~ car_data$am + car_data$wt + car_data$am:car_data$wt)
summary(car_model_3)

# Likelihood ratio test between the two best models
lrtest(car_model_2, car_model_3)

# Displaying the best model:
car_model_4 <- lm(car_data$mpg ~ car_data$am + car_data$wt + car_data$cyl +
                   car_data$am:car_data$wt + car_data$wt:car_data$cyl)
car_model_4

## Model Choices
# -1. The baseline model (car_model_1) only looked at the relationship between transmission and MPG. 
# -2. The Residual Squared Error was 4.9 which is the transmission prediction with # respect to MPG.
# -3. The slope coeffecient of 7.24 infers that switching from automtic transmission to manual transmission gives 7.24 extra miles per gallon.  
# -4. The R-squared value for the model was .36, which shows that only 36% of MPG is attributable to the type of transmission. 


# Since the Residual Squared Error as well as the R-squared values were not so good other models were built and used which had an added predictor. 
# The second model - car_plot_2 was compared to a third model - car_plot_3 which looked at the interaction between transmission and weight as a predictor for MPG. 
# The p.value for the Liklihood Ratio was .0004 which is highly signficant, so the model that included the interaction was maintained. 
# The Residual Squared Error for the model which included weight, transmission and their interaction as predictors was 2.6 and the R-squared was .83. 
# This was a huge improvement and the model explains 83% of the variance in MPG with an error of only 2.6 miles per gallon. 

### Regression Check
# The last step is to check the validity of the model. So I need to check the 4 assumptions required to use a linear model as a predictor. 

# -1. The Y-values can be expressed as a linear function of the X-variable
# -2. The variation of observations around the regression line shows homoscedasticity.
# -3. For a given value of X, the Y-value show a normal distribution

# These can be checked very simply with the 4 plots generated by base-R's plot() function and shows the different inferences. 

```{r,Regression Check}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(car_model_4)
```
